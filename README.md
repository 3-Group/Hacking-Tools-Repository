----------
This is a list of security tools that have been collected from the internet. These tools are specifically aimed toward security professionals and enthusiasts/hobbyists for testing and demonstrating security weaknesses.

These tools are created for the sole purpose of security awareness and education, they should not be used against systems that you do not have permission to test/attack. You could end up in jail.

Most of the tools are open source/free with a couple of exceptions, before using any tools, i recommend that you read the instructions/documentation available on each of the individual tool's websites. Although some of the tools could be listed in more than one category, they only appear in the list only once, under its primary category.
